* Developed a CNN model to classify MRI scans of autism spectrum disorder and neurotypical brains.
* Model architecture was optimized.
* Transfer learning with pre-trained model VGG16 was tested.
* Achieved 68% classification accuracy through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation and optimization.
* Utilized Python, TensorFlow, and data visualization tools for model development and interpretation.
